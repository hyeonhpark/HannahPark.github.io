In this blog post, I attempt to answer the following questions: What does it mean to be a data scientist? What are the major duties and/or knowledge areas of a data scientist? What differences/similarities are there between data scientists and statisticians? How do I view myself in relation to the two areas?

I want to start out with the third question: what are the differences and similarities between a data scientist and a statistician? Answering this question helps to understand what it means to be a data scientist and what the role entails. 

In my opinion, the biggest difference between a data scientist and a statistician is the size of the data that they deal with. The term “data science” is relatively new, and its coinage can be attributed to the rapid increase in the amount of data collected in relation to the advancements in computer technology. On the other hand, statistics had existed for centuries before data science became a thing. The two areas are similar in that they extract useful information from data, but the way they collect and handle data are different. 

So then, what does it mean to be a data scientist? I think, to be a data scientist, you need to have a strong background in both statistics and computer science with a stronger emphasis on the latter. For a data scientist, strong computing skills are required in order to deal with mining, cleansing, preparing and manipulating big data, and in-depth knowledge in statistical practices is required to apply the appropriate methods of analysis to the data. Unlike a statistician, however, a data scientist seldom sets up experiments which requires designing studies, determining number of subjects required for sound analysis, and etc. In this sense, I relate more to statisticians than data scientists.
