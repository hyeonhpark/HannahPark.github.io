For this blog post, I am to go back and read the the previous blog posts I wrote on data science and usign R, and write a reflection about:  

what (if anything) has changed about what you think a data scientist is and what they do  
what your current thoughts are in terms of using R for data science - do you think you'll continue to use R going forward?  Why or why not?  
what things are you going to do differently in practice now that you've had this course  

Initially, when I was asked about what the difference was between data scientists and statisticians, I said it's the size of the data that they deal with. After taking this course, that definition has changed in a way. I still think that data scientists and statisticians can be distinguised by the size of the data that they deal with,  but the magnitude of the difference I once perceived has shrunk. In the end, both data scientists and statisticians run the same type of analysis for their respective data, even though sometimes they are referred to as different names. I also said in my first post that data scientists need better coding skills than statisticians, and I stand by that opinion. With more data to deal with, data scientists would need extra skills up their sleeves to manipulate them.

I will definitely continue to use R going forward, especially now that I've learned all the wonders of the tidyverse package. I've worked with another statistical software before, namely SAS, and I learned through this course that data manipulation is much more flexible and straight-forward when it's done in R. I still think that performing statistical analyses is better done in SAS, given the not-so-reliable nature of some of the packages in R. However, I see the possibility of using the two programs together since each has their pros and their cons. Perhaps data manipulation and initial data exploration can be done in R while the statistical analyses is done in SAS. I still cannot decide which program draws prettier pictures, but it was definitely easier in R than in SAS. It's an area I will continue to explore.
