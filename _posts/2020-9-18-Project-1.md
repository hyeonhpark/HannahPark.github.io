For this project, we were tasked with creating a vignette. Vignettes are explanations of some concept, package, etc. with text, code, and output interweaved. My vignette was for reading and summarizing data from the National Hockey League’s (NHL) API. We created functions to access the data for different endpoints from the NHL records API. These endpoints included franchise data, total stats data for every franchise, season records (such as fewest goals for and against and their respective season IDs) for specific franchises, and goalie records and skater records with player statistics.  

Once you’ve completed your vignette you should write a brief blog post:
• explaining what you did in the project and any findings you made
• You should also reflect on the process you went through for this project. Discuss things like:
– what would you do differently in approaching the project?
– what was the most difficult part of the logic and programming for you?
– what are your big take-aways for future projects?
