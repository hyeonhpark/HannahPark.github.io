For project 2, we were tasked with creating tree models to make predictions about the count of total bike rentals from a bike-sharing system data. I personally had more fun with this project than I had with project 1, mainly because the data used for project 2 was more straight forward than the data used for project 1. All major struggles I had with project 1 were related to the data itself: not knowing what the different terms referred to, not knowing how to approach the analysis, and etc. For project 2, the data was easy to understand. We had a clear response variable, and the predictor variables were simple enough that I was able to include, exclude, transform the variables as I saw them fit. Generally, I had a pretty smooth progress with project 2. The struggles I had were minimal. 



Once you’ve completed the above tasks you should write a brief blog post outlining your project and linking
to the username.github.io/repo-name site. You should then also reflect on the process you went through for
this project. Discuss things like:
• what would you do differently?
• what was the most difficult part for you?
• what are your big take-aways from this project?
• In your blog post, provide a link to your github pages repo
