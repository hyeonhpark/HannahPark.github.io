title: Using R
---

Prompt: 
Everyone in this course had some programming experience coming in (due to the prerequisites).  
What are your thoughts on R vs whatever other software you've used?  
What functionality do you like about R?  What parts do you miss about your other language?  
Do you consider R a difficult language to learn? (If you knew R prior to the course, describe your experience when first learning it.)  

I have experience programming in SAS and in R, and I learned them in that order. I first learned to program in SAS and then in R. Learning to program in SAS was relatively easier than learning to program in R. When I first started coding in SAS, I had no prior knowledge in programming, but I didn't have much difficulty learning the language. My experience with SAS mostly had to do with data management, and the way that SAS language is written made it easy to learn. On the other hand, when I learned to code in R, I've had some experience coding in other languages such as SAS and typescript. Though SAS and R are very different, typescript and R share certain similarities, and having experience coding in typescript helped in learning to code in R. However, unlike SAS, I think it would've been much more difficult for me to learn R if I hadn't taken the introductory course in computer programming where I learned to code in typescript. This was especially true because when I first learned to code in R, it wasn't from a course designed to teach you how to code in R from the basics. It was from a course that required the use of R in running statistical analyses, and I had to learn everything from the very basics, such as the definition of vector and how to assign a vector to a variable, from the internet on my own. Again, if I had not had the one course in typescript, it would've been much more difficult for me to learn to code in R.

Despite the difficulty in first learning the language, I think R is a great tool. One thing I really love about R is
